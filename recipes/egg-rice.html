            <li>2 eggs </li>
            <li>2 tbsp dark soy sauce </li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt </li>
            <li>1/4 tsp garlic salt </li>
            <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 spring onions</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2><strong> Steps </strong></h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp of the oil in a large wok. Add the onion and cook, stirring regularly on a medium heat for 5 minutes until the onion starts to turn soft and translucent.</li>

            <li>Add in the remaining vegetable oil and the minced garlic.
            Cook for a further 30 seconds, stirring regularly. </li>

            <li>Add the rice and turn up the heat to high. Then drizzle over the sesame oil. </li>


            <li>Use a spatula to toss everything together and to ensure the rice doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. 
            Keep moving the ricea round so that it's all getting reheated. </li>

            <li>Once the rice is hot, push the rice over to the side of the pan and crack the two eggs in the space.
            Add a little splash of the soy sauce to the eggs. </li>

            <li>Making sure the part of the wok with the eggs in is over the heat, fry the eggs, giving a mix with the spatula until the egg starts to cook and looks scrambled, but is still a little runny.</li>
        
            <li>Now mix the egg into the rice.</li>

            <li>Pour in the remaining soy sauce, sprinkle on the salt, and garlic salt and mix it all together.</li>

            <li>Add the lemon juice, stir and taste. Add a little more lemon juice if required.</li>

            <li>Divide between 4 bowls. Top with spring onions. </li>
        </ol>
