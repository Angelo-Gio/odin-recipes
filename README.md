# odin-recipes
This project will be a basic recipe website. It will consist of a main index page with a few links to recipes.

The skills I will have demonstrated when this project has been completed are: Creating the HTML boilerplate, using tags to emphasize, bolden, and separate text, inserting images with their attributes, such as alt, height and width. Additionally, I will be using both absolute links and relative links. Lastly, lists both ordered and unordered will be used as well.

Once the website itself is done, I will also have demonstrated my ability to commit messages, add files to the staging area, thereafter committing them as well.
